**Potato Disease Classification**

**Aim**: To develop a model to classify potato leaf images into three categories: "Early Blight," "Late Blight," and "No Disease." 
**Solution**: Implemented efficient image data preprocessing and feeding to the model using the tf.data input pipeline. Employed data augmentation, resizing, and a CNN architecture to capture spatial features, achieving 99% accuracy in potato disease classification.
**Results**: Generated outputs with actual labels, predicted labels, and confidence scores for the predictions.
